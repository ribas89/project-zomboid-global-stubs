This repository contains **Lua stub files** generated for *Project Zomboid* build **42.11.0**.  

## Whatâ€™s Inside
- **Stub files only**: These are placeholder files meant for IDE auto-completion, static analysis, and mod development.

- **No game assets or proprietary code** are included.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to provide mod developers with:
- **Code completion** in editors like VS Code or IntelliJ.
- **Type hints and API references** without exposing any original game source code.
